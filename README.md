# Crossout Bot
Hi, this is the source code of the popular discord bot for tracking prices in the in-game market in the game crossout. The bot allows you to find out the price of an item in real time, find out the characteristics of the item, and compare them.
There is my official discord server dedicated to this bot. Come in if you want to be the first to hear the news.
